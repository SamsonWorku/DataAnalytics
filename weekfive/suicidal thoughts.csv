I disagree with this because I’ve had suicidal thoughts and the only thing that I held onto was that it would affect others 100x worse than how I was feeling
Every person who actually thinks this is deep has never had suicidal thoughts and doesn’t understand them at all. 
"People with suicidal thoughts aren’t all affected the same way by this post. We do understand that some people gain strength to keep going on from posts like these, but not everyone does and it can affect them negatively in the long run."
This mentality can make people who have suicidal thoughts feel even more guilty about being suicidal. We need to be kinder to those living with suicidal thoughts because posts like this can make their mental health worse off. 
This mindset is so damaging. People who suffer from suicidal thoughts spend weeks/months at a time hiding their pain so that they don’t hurt their loved ones b/c they know it will burden them. If you think this is deep u don’t understand depression AT ALL 
Imagine a world where people didn’t make you feel guilty for struggling with suicidal thoughts

The issue w/ this sign is not the message they are trying to get across but the wording. Suicidal thoughts & depression are not transferable pain. Experiencing loss due to someone killing them self is not the same as living with depression. It’s a selfish perspective.
"when will yall stop making suicide/suicidal thoughts about the people surrounding the person who is ACTUALLY suffering?

"This sign can be interpreted how you wish. However, instead of looking at it from a negative perspective, you can look at it as informing people with suicidal thoughts that they are loved and cared for, and the people that love them will be hurt and miss them if they’re gone"
